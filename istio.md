# Install Istio
First download istioctl.

```
cd ./istio
wget https://github.com/istio/istio/releases/download/1.4.0/istioctl-1.4.0-linux.tar.gz
tar -xvf istioctl-1.4.0-linux.tar.gz
sudo mv ./istioctl /usr/local/bin/
rm -rf istioctl-1.4.0-linux.tar.gz
```

Deploy Secrets to configure Grafana and Kiali username/password. File in this repo containers user/Azure12345678.

```bash
kubectl create namespace istio-system --save-config
kubectl apply -f grafanaSecret.yaml
kubectl apply -f kialiSecret.yaml
```

Deploy Istio using basic settings provided here in istioConfig.yaml.

```bash
istioctl manifest apply -f istioConfig.yaml
```

# Accessing GUI
Istioctl has deployed couple of GUI components, but those are not exposed to outside world by default (you may use Ingress to do so, but first make sure security is done right including authn/authz and https). To access only for AKS authenticated user we will use port-forward to pod running GUI. Istioctl provides shortcut for this commend.

```bash
istioctl dashboard grafana
istioctl dashboard prometheus
istioctl dashboard jaeger
istioctl dashboard kiali
istioctl dashboard envoy <pod-name>.<namespace>
```

# Deploy with istio
Let's now deploy our demo services with Istio Service Mesh.

```bash
kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
kubectl apply -f client.yaml
kubectl apply -f retryBackend.yaml
kubectl apply -f canary.yaml
```

## Retry functionality
First run client without any policy defined. We are using retry backend application that acceps failRate as argument and based on this percentage will either respond or crash the Pod. We will use 50% chance of getting no response and container crash.

```bash
export clientPod=$(kubectl get pods -l app=client -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- curl -vs -m 10 retry-service?failRate=50
```

Now apply Istio policy to retry.

```bash
kubectl apply -f retryVirtualService.yaml
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- curl -vs -m 10 retry-service?failRate=50
```

As you can see you now get response even if your first request causes container to crash. This demonstrates retry functionality in Istio.

## Copy traffic
Sometimes it might be useful to get copy of traffic for troubleshooting for example to copy production API requests to beta service. We will deploy sniffer, which is simple image that runs tcpdump on port 80 and use Istio VirtualService to copy traffic between client and retry-service to sniffer.

```bash
kubectl apply -f sniffer.yaml
kubectl apply -f copyVirtualService.yaml

export clientPod=$(kubectl get pods -l app=client -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- bash -c 'for x in {0..20}; do curl -s retry-service?failRate=1; done'
export snifferPod=$(kubectl get pods -l app=sniffer -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl logs $snifferPod -c sniffer
```

## Canary deployments
Istio allows you to have better control over routing your traffic to different versions of services independently of infrastructure configuration (eg. number of pods with each service).

In our example we have 3 instances of v1 and 3 instances of v2 so we are 50% likely to hit v2.
```bash
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- bash -c 'while true; do curl -s myweb-service; echo; done'
```

Let's now configure Istio to send just 10% of traffic to v2. We will define DestinationRule where we configure two subsets (versions) identified by labels version: v1 and version: v2. Then we configure VirtualService that reference those two subsets and use 90 weight for v1 and 10 weight for v2. We should hit v2 only in 10% of requests.

```bash
kubectl apply -f canary10percent.yaml
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- bash -c 'while true; do curl -s myweb-service; echo; done'
```

What about serving v2 only for user with specific cookie? First let's remove our previous policy.

```bash
kubectl delete -f canary10percent.yaml
```

In order to achieve what we need to configure two rules in our VirtualService. First (v2) will have match statement that will check cookie for usertype-tester. If there is no match second (default) one (v1) will be used for ordinary users.

```bash
kubectl apply -f canaryCookie.yaml
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- curl -s myweb-service
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- curl -s --cookie "usertype=tester" myweb-service
```

## Managing access to services outside Istio with ServiceEntry
By default services in Istio mesh can access external systems without any restrictions. You can test following curl command works.

```bash
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- curl -vs httpbin.org/ip
```

We will now change policy to deny all services unless some are explicitly allowed. Reconfigure Istio:

```bash
kubectl get configmap istio -n istio-system -o yaml | sed 's/mode: ALLOW_ANY/mode: REGISTRY_ONLY/g' | kubectl replace -n istio-system -f -
```

Test access from Pod now - it should fail with 502 Bas Gateway.

```bash
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- curl -vs httpbin.org/ip
```

Let's now define ServiceEntry for your Istio Service Mesh to allow access to httpbin.org and try again.

```bash
kubectl create -f serviceEntry.yaml
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- curl -vs httpbin.org/ip
```

## Managing access to services in Istio from outside with Gateway
As all traffic between services might be encrypted outside users cannot access services directly. In order to expose service such as web frontend to users outside of cluster we will use Istio Gateway. This is in principle similar to Kubernetes Ingress, but Istio provides specific implementation for entering services managed by Istio Service Mesh.

Deploy Gateway to make service accessible from outside of our cluster.

```bash
kubectl delete -f canary10percent.yaml
kubectl create -f gateway.yaml
```

Find out on which IP address Istio Ingress is running (Helm chart created service instanci of ty LoadBalancer so Azure provided external address to it).

```bash
export istioGwIp=$(kubectl get service istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
```

Check access to service extrenally.

```bash
curl -i $istioGwIp -H "Host:myweb-service.domain.com"
```

In order to deploy URL paths and TLS certificates please refer to [this part of demo](docs/networking.md)

## Load-balancing algorithms
Istio comes with multiple load-balancing algorithms. If session stickiness is required consistent hash option is available based on some information from header such as Cookie or specific Header entry or via client source IP.

First we will deploy policy for round robin. We expect to see responses in sequences (one by one and again).

```bash
kubectl delete -f canary10percent.yaml
kubectl apply -f lbRandom.yaml
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- bash -c 'while true; do curl -s myweb-service; echo; sleep 0.2; done'
```

Suppose we need caller to be always routed to the same Pod. There might be two reasons for this:
* Your application code is "traditional" and keeps state such as user session in memory rather than in external system such as Redis
* Your application needs to keep local cache in memory due to performance reasons and sending user to the same instance increase cache hit ration

We will setup persistence based on header key User. When key is not specified Istio will fall back to Random mode. If key is present we will get response from the same node for all subsequent calls (unless instance fails).

```bash
kubectl apply -f lbHeaderHash.yaml
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- bash -c 'while true; do curl -s myweb-service; echo; sleep 0.2; done'
kubectl exec $clientPod -c client -- bash -c 'while true; do curl -H "User: tomas" -s myweb-service; echo; sleep 0.2; done'
```

# Clean up
```
kubectl delete -f .
istioctl manifest generate -f istioConfig.yaml | kubectl delete -f -
kubectl get secret --all-namespaces -o json | jq '.items[].metadata | ["kubectl delete secret -n", .namespace, .name] | join(" ")' -r | fgrep "istio." | xargs -t0 bash -c
```
